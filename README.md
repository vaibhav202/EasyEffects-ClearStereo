# ClearStereo for EasyEffects
## A preset for [EasyEffects](https://github.com/wwmm/easyeffects).

ClearStereo is a combination of channel delay and channel flipping to produce a broad gap between left and right channel. 
I have included an equalizer as well to further enhance the listening experience.
